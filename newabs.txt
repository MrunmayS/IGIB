Corona virus disease (COVID-19) has been declared as a controllable pandemic by  the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 though is a predominantly  respiratory illness; it can also affect brain and other organs like kidneys,  heart and liver. Neuropsychiatric manifestations are common during viral  pandemics but are not effectively addressed. Fever and cough are common symptoms  only in infected individuals but headache and sleep disturbances are common even  in uninfected general public. In this selective review, the authors report the  available evidence of neuropsychiatric morbidity during the current COVID-19  crisis. The authors also discuss the postulated neuronal mechanisms of the  corona virus infection sequelae.  Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Rapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection is one of  the cornerstones of pandemic control. With the myriad of tests available in the  market, the use of correct specimen type and laboratory-testing technique in the  right clinical scenario could be challenging for non-specialists. In this  mini-review, we will discuss the difference in diagnostic performance for  different upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and the role of blood and  fecal specimens. We will analyze the performance characteristics of laboratory  testing techniques of nucleic acid amplification tests, antigen detection tests,  antibody detection tests, and point-of-care tests. Finally, the dynamics of  viral replication and antibody production, and laboratory results interpretation  in conjunction with clinical scenarios will be discussed.  Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Based on its phylogenetic relationships and  genomic structures the COVID-19 belongs to genera Betacoronavirus. Human  Betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) have many similarities,  but also have differences in their genomic and phenotypic structure that can  influence their pathogenesis. COVID-19 is containing single-stranded  (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised  of matrix protein. A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome. All  the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs.  Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the  genome near the 3'-terminus. The genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in  pathogenesis is important. This article highlights the most important of these  features compared to other Betacoronaviruses.  Copyright © 2021.

COVID-19: Therapeutics and interventions currently under consideration.  McFee RB(1).  Author information: (1)Medical Director, Ellis Medical Consulting, Massachusetts, USA. Electronic  address: drmcfee2020@gmail.com.  With the emergence of COVID-19 extensive research began to identify medications,  candidate compounds and other therapeutic approaches. The complex virology of  COVID-19 may provide multiple potential target points for antiviral therapy, and  vaccines; extensive global research is underway to exploit these potential  opportunities. The complex pathophysiology, pulmonary and extrapulmonary  disease, and immune mediated effects such as cytokine storm, make medical  management more challenging than many viral illnesses. Non medication based  interventions including hyperbaric oxygen (HBOT), extracorporeal membrane  oxygenation (ECMO), aggressive dialysis, and other interventions, all with  various degrees of clinical success, and will be discussed in this section.  Several antivirals approved for other clinical indications were studied for  repurposing against COVID-19, which we highlight, again with varying results. In  addition to therapeutics, concern was raised over potential risks associated  with ACE inhibitors and ARB use, which is presented. Often the timing of the  medication determined its clinical benefit as will be discussed with  dexamethasone and other medications. As such, this Therapeutics Review will  present prominent and/or promising medications and therapeutic approaches with  the caveats that 1. To date, none are FDA approved beyond emergency use  authorization (EUA), and 2. Although a comprehensive look at various classes of  interventions, it is by no means a complete list of every compound trialed  against COVID-19. Recognizing the knowledge basis upon which we treat COVID-19  patients, develop therapeutics, and vaccines continues to evolve as new  information is presented, every effort nevertheless has been made to provide as  timely information as possible. It is hoped that the information shared can help  guide the clinician in terms of potential options to treat this complex group of  patients.  Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak all over the world has led the  researchers to strive to develop drugs or vaccines to prevent or halt the  progression of this ailment. To hasten the treatment process, repurposed drugs  are being evaluated. Favipiravir is one such oral drug that was approved for new  and reemerging pandemic influenza in Japan in 2014 and has shown potent in vitro  activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. It has a wide  therapeutic safety margin indicated by a wide CC50/EC50 ratio for a high dose.  From the clinical studies in COVID-19, it has shown rapid viral clearance as  compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) and superior recovery rate than  umifenovir. Overall, favipiravir has shown promising results in clinical studies  in China, Russia, and Japan, and more trials are underway in multiple countries,  including USA, UK, and India. Recently, treatment guidelines from many countries  and some states from India have included favipiravir in the treatment protocol.  This review provides insights into the evidence-based evolving role of  favipiravir in the management of COVID-19 infection with emphasis on benefits of  initiating an early antiviral therapy with special focus on favipiravir, its  pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, in vitro, clinical data, and inclusion in the  treatment protocols of COVID-19.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) outbreak, which has caused >46 millions  confirmed infections and >1.2 million coronavirus related deaths, is one of the  most devastating worldwide crises in recent years. Infection with COVID‑19  results in a fever, dry cough, general fatigue, respiratory symptoms, diarrhoea  and a sore throat, similar to those of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The  causative agent of COVID‑19, SARS‑CoV‑2, is a novel coronavirus strain. To date,  remdesivir has been granted emergency use authorization for use in the  management of infection. Additionally, several efficient diagnostic tools are  being actively developed, and novel drugs and vaccines are being evaluated for  their efficacy as therapeutic agents against COVID‑19, or in the prevention of  infection. The present review highlights the prevalent clinical manifestations  of COVID‑19, characterizes the SARS‑CoV‑2 viral genome sequence and life cycle,  highlights the optimal methods for preventing viral transmission, and discusses  possible molecular pharmacological mechanisms and approaches in the development  of anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2 therapeutic agents. In addition, the use of traditional  Chinese medicines for management of COVID‑19 is discussed. It is expected that  novel anti‑viral agents, vaccines or an effective combination therapy for  treatment/management of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection and spread therapy will be  developed and implemented in 2021, and we would like to extend our best regards  to the frontline health workers across the world in their fight against  COVID‑19.

INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has the characteristics of  high transmission, diverse clinical manifestations, and a long incubation  period. In addition to infecting the respiratory system, COVID-19 also has  adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. COVID-19 causes acute myocardial  injuries, as well as chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. AREAS COVERED: The present review is aimed at providing current information on  COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system. PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, and  Google Scholar were searched. EXPERT OPINION: It is suggested that heart injury caused by COVID-19 infection  might be an important cause of severe clinical phenotypes or adverse events in  affected patients. Myocardial damage is closely related to the severity of the  disease and even the prognosis in patients with COVID-19. In addition to  disorders that are caused by COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system, more  protection should be employed for patients with preexisting cardiovascular  disease (CVD). Hence, it is very important that once relevant symptoms appear,  patients with COVID-19 be rapidly treated to reduce mortality. Thus, early  measurements of cardiac damage via biomarkers following hospitalization for  COVID-19 infections in a patient with preexisting CVD are recommended, together  with careful monitoring of any myocardial injury that might be caused by the  infection.Abbreviations: ICU: An intensive care unit; 2019-nCoV: 2019 novel  coronavirus; ACEI: ACE inhibitor; ACS: Acute coronary syndrome; ARDS: Acute  respiratory distress syndrome; AT1R: Ang II type 1 receptor; ATP: Adenosine  triphosphate; ACC: American College of Cardiology; ACE: Angiotensin converting  enzyme; Ang II: Angiotensin II; ARB: Angiotensin II receptor blocker; AV block:  Atrioventricular block; CAD: Coronary artery disease; CVD: Cardiovascular  disease; CT: Computerized tomography; CHF: Congestive heart failure; CHD:  Coronary heart disease; CK-MB: Creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB; CRP: C-reactive  protein; cTnI: Cardiac troponin I; EAT: Epicardial adipose tissue; ECMO:  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; FDA: Food and Drug Administration; G-CSF:  Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; HFrEF: HF with a reduced ejection  fraction; synhACE2: Human isoform of ACE2; IL: Interleukin; IABP: Intra-aortic  balloon counterpulsation; IP10: Interferon γ-induced protein 10 kDa; LPC:  Lysophosphatidylcholine; Mas: Mitochondrial assembly receptor; MCP1: Monocyte  chemoattractant protein-1; MERS: Middle East respiratory syndrome; MIP1a:  macrophage inflammatory protein 1a: MOF: Multiple organ failure; MI: Myocardial  infarction; MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging; MYO: Myohe-moglobin; NT-proBNP:  N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide; PCPS: Percutaneous cardiopulmonary  assistance; rhACE2: Recombinant human ACE2; SARS: Severe acute respiratory  syndrome; Th: T helper; RAS: Renin-angiotensin system; TNF-α: Tumor necrosis  factor-α; WHO: World Health Organization.

Currently, there are no treatment options available for the deadly contagious  disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Drug repurposing is a process of  identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs and it is considered  as a very effective strategy for drug discovery as it involves less time and  cost to find a therapeutic agent in comparison to the de novo drug discovery  process. The present review will focus on the repurposing efficacy of the  currently used drugs against COVID-19 and their mechanisms of action,  pharmacokinetics, dosing, safety, and their future perspective. Relevant  articles with experimental studies conducted in-silico, in-vitro, in-vivo,  clinical trials in humans, case reports, and news archives were selected for the  review. Number of drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir,  ritonavir, darunavir, arbidol, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab and  interferons have shown inhibitory effects against the SARS-CoV2 in-vitro as well  as in clinical conditions. These drugs either act through virus-related targets  such as RNA genome, polypeptide packing and uptake pathways or target  host-related pathways involving angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors  and inflammatory pathways. Using the basic knowledge of viral pathogenesis and  pharmacodynamics of drugs as well as using computational tools, many drugs are  currently in pipeline to be repurposed. In the current scenario, repositioning  of the drugs could be considered the new avenue for the treatment of COVID-19.  DOI: 10.1007/s43440-020-00155-6 PMCID: PMC7474498	32889701
